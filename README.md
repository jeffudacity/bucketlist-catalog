## Motivation

This Catalog Bucketlist website has been created as a project for Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree.


## Further Development
I have created it as standard as possible so it can be easily reused.
As a consequence, they are 3 tables in the database: User, Category and Item.
Item correspond here to goals, but if you modify the front-end, it can be anything (gifts, books). It's the same for categories which you can change to people or places in the front-end.
